# Welcome to Web-Park!
## Introduction ðŸ“ƒ

Web Park is a [Kotlin](https://kotlinlang.org/) application where users can book parking spaces online.

## Contributing
Everyone is welcome to contribute to this project, particularly those willing to share their knowledge on Kotlin.

As a beginner, I'm probably writing a lot of contradicting code. You are welcome to contribute, review, and share your feedback (particularly **negative feedback**).

By telling me what I am doing wrong, you help me to learn and improve my skills as a programmer.

## Application goals ðŸ“Œ
While building this application, I want to:
- [x] Use the [Spock Framework](https://spockframework.org/) to test the code
- [ ] Learn some Kotlin fundamentals
- [ ] Implement [JSON Web Tokens (JWT)](https://jwt.io/) 
- [ ] Create a password-encrypt algorithm
- [ ] Implement a queue mechanism using [Kafka](https://kafka.apache.org/)
